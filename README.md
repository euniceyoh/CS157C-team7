# Concert Mate 

Concert Mate is a web app designed to find people to enjoy concerts together with. Users will be able to easily connect with other concertgoers, meet people who have complimenting music interests, store a memento of their concert history, and create a network with whom theyâ€™ve shared their concert experiences with. 


### Problem & Solution  
We wanted to provide a platform for people who enjoy attending concerts and have difficulty finding people with similar music tastes to go together with. We wanted to provide people the opportunity to expand their network, meet others and learn about their musical interests, and ultimately decide if they would like to become concert buddies.
